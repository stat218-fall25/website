## Meet Your Instructor

Life science is complicated. As your professor, I know you already know this, and it's not my intention to teach you that. However, I am committed to giving you a glimpse into some of these complexities by integrating statistical concepts into life science topics. By the end of this course, I hope to increase your statistical literacy and data literacy. In the best-case scenario, I will support you in making sense of uncertainty in the (1) behavior of chemicals, (2) relationships among living organisms & communities of living organisms, and (3) physical processes that sustain most of the living systems through the use of statistics.
