While I won’t be assigning grades specifically for this subject, I encourage you to explore and assess your progress in achieving these objectives. Additionally, you can learn more about sustainability topics by coming to my office or reaching out to ask.\nBelow, I’ve included Cal Poly’s definition of sustainability and its associated learning objectives. I am planning to integrate 1st and 4th learning objectives specifically.\nCal Poly defines sustainability as the ability of the natural and social systems to survive and thrive together to meet current and future needs. In order to consider sustainability when making reasoned decisions, all graduating students should be able to:\n1. Define and apply sustainability principles within their academic programs,\n2. Explain how natural, economic, and social systems interact to foster or prevent sustainability,\n3. Analyze and explain local, national, and global sustainability using a multidisciplinary approach,\n4. Consider sustainability principles while developing personal and professional values.\n\nImage by Freepik"

    "text": "Assessment Types\nOur weekly units/topics will follow a pattern and have been designed to give you practice with the concepts. Below you will find brief descriptions of the types of assignments in this course.\n\nAttendance and Participation\nYour attendance plays a crucial role in your ability to succeed in every type of assessment conducted in our class, as consistent absences may interrupt your learning and indirectly impact your grades. I will record attendance during every lecture, not only for grading purposes, but also to track your learning progress in this class. In case of recurring absences, I will reach out to understand the reasons and work together to find solutions.\nYour active involvement enriches our learning environment and enhances everyone’s experience. Active involvement isn’t about speaking up every day; it’s about actively engaging with the material and activities. I respect that everyone learns differently. Whether you’re comfortable sharing your thoughts in class or prefer a more reserved approach or seek clarification when needed, your participation is valued and will be recognized. As long as you provide these indicators, you will get the full credit from your participation.\nIn brief, you must be present in our classroom (both physically and mentally) unless you have an “Excusable” Reason for Missing Class and participate in classroom activities. Please contact with me in advance if you are not coming and do your best to catch up what we have done in that day. You can also come to my office hours or schedule a virtual appointment if you have questions about the missing class you had.\n\n\nMidterm and Final Exams\nExams are to be taken without the use of textbooks or notes. It is expected that you will take exams as per the scheduled times. In cases of extraordinary circumstances like illness, a family loss, please inform me before the examination.\nYou won’t be required to computer for the exams, but you may see some questions that involve filling in missing information, interpreting provided R outputs, or selecting the appropriate code to complete a task.\nThu, Oct 16: Midterm Exam\nSat, Dec 6: Final Exam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you miss one of the key assessments (midterm, group project presentation, and/or final exam) and do not contact your instructor or complete a make-up exam within one week of the deadline for these assessments, your final letter grade will initially be recorded as “Incomplete”.\nAn incomplete grade indicates that you have not finished all the required coursework. Please contact your instructor with me in advance if you miss any of these key assessments and complete the make-up exam to avoid your incomplete grade turning into an F.\n\n\n\n\nProject Presentation\nThe overarching goal of the project in this course is to empower students to become independent learners. This involves actively engaging with the learning process and taking ownership of your academic journey. You will have the opportunity to present a scientific article related to your major and include the following dimensions: (1) summarize the study, (2) identify its research question(s) and statistical procedures used, and (3) evaluate whether the study effectively communicated its findings. This approach not only enhances your understanding of how Statistics is utilized in your field but also fosters a proactive and self-directed approach to learning. Detailed rubric will be provided as a template on your Canvas page.\nThu, Nov 13: Group Presentations (will be uploaded online)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYour project grade is composed of following components:\nProject Slides: 40 points\nProject Oral Presentation: 35 points\nProject Peer Evaluation: 25 points\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Assignments\nYou will have individual assignments every week, typically consisting of daily assignments per week. Please upload them collectively, using a format like ‘Week X Assignment Name Lastname’.\nThese assignments are individual assignments to track your learning progress. You can do these assignments either using your PC/Laptop/iPad/Chromebook or solve them to your notebook. Either way, you should upload them to Canvas. All weekly assignments are due Mondays at 11.59 pm.\n\n\nInvestigation Assignments\nThere will be 8 investigation assignments, given every Tuesday, to be completed in this course. These assignments will focus on a key statistical concept. You are encouraged to work in groups of up to 3 people and submit one write-up with all group members’ names. If your partner is absent on a given day, feel free to join another group. All investigation assignments are due Thursdays by 11:59 p.m.\n\n\nLab Assignments\nThere will be 8 labs to complete in this course. Most labs should be finished during class time. Make sure to follow the lab write-up instructions carefully.\nLab sessions will be conducted in groups, and lab assignments will also be group assignments. Each group will consist of 2-3 students, who will work together to complete the labs both during and after class. If your partner is absent on a given day, feel free to join another group. All lab assignments are due Mondays at 11:59 p.m.\nImportant: Please only include the names of group members who actively participated. If a group member is absent, they must either complete the assignment individually or coordinate with their group to finish it together. Feel free to shuffle groups if your partner is absent."

These “grace days” can be used all at once on a single assignment or used on separate assignments throughout the quarter. Simply add a comment on the assignment in Canvas BEFORE THE DEADLINE.\nAfter the expiration of your ‘grace days’, a 10% grade reduction will be applied for each day that the assignment is overdue. Late submissions will not be accepted after one week from the original due date. Resubmitting assignments is not allowed."

    "section": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools Usage Policy",
    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools Usage Policy\nGenerative AI tools, which create text, images, code, audio, and other content, are widely available. However, AI tools should not be seen to avoid learning the material, but rather as a tool that can help you master content and produce better results. Use AI responsibly and ethically, ensuring that your own ideas are the focus. Keep your academic integrity intact and make sure your own ideas shine through. Always cite AI contributions to maintain academic integrity.\nAI is allowed for certain assignments as specified below. Otherwise, do not use AI tools. If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they may\n\nbe trained on outdated, biased, or copyrighted materials\n\nresult in plagiarism, copyright issues, or inaccuracies\n\nTherefore, you are responsible for ensuring the quality and accuracy of your work, not the AI. When permitted, generative AI use must be properly documented and credited according to APA style. For example:\n\nOpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\nParenthetical citation: (OpenAI, 2023)\n\nNarrative citation: OpenAI (2023)\n\n\nAdvice:\n\nGood prompts lead to better AI results.\n\nAlways verify AI-generated facts or data.\n\n\nAssignment Guidelines\nMidterm and Final Exams: AI use is prohibited.\nProject Presentations: You may use AI to understand articles, but your presentation must be original. Attach any AI conversations to your project.\nLab Assignments: You may use AI for coding, but only after attempting the task yourself. Understanding the computer language is essential in this course and you will primarily adjust provided code rather than write from scratch. Attach any AI conversations to your submission.\nInvestigation & Weekly Assignments: These assignments are designed to develop your statistical reasoning and problem-solving skills. AI tools are not yet reliable for these tasks: they often make mistakes that look very different from the kinds of errors humans make. As an instructor, it’s easy to recognize when work reflects an AI’s output rather than a student’s reasoning.\nMore importantly, relying on AI without applying your own critical thinking undermines the value of your college education. Use AI tools responsibly — your judgment and expertise are what distinguish you as a learner and future professional.\nHowever, you are encouraged to use AI tools to clarify concepts, check your understanding, or generate practice problems, as long as you remain the one doing the reasoning and evaluating. Think of AI as a study companion, not a substitute for your own work.\nUnauthorized use of AI for assignments will be considered a violation of the course’s academic integrity policy, and appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with Cal Poly’s Academic Dishonesty policy."
